## Welcome to my GitHub homepage! 

My name is Young He, and I am an incoming student to the CS MEng program at Cornell Tech. 

Aside from my academic coursework, I am performing research under the guidance of Professor Zhiru Zhang. My interests lie within the applications of machine learning in electronic design automation (EDA), as well as general research in core machine learning algorithms. 

Previously, I received a B.S. in Computer Science \& Engineering and a B.S. in Mathematics (Highest Honors) from UCLA. I also worked as a software engineering intern at Cadence for a year, focusing on developing PnR technologies for the Innovus Implementation System.
